# Classroom-Observation-Protocol-
The aim of project is to provide a scalable way to implement COPUS protocols for quantifying aspects of teaching. The platform created will allow instructors to judge accurately how much time they are spending in active learning versus a more traditional lecture. This will allow instructors to make more informed decision about how they might modify their future class work. In short term, the project will trigger more active learning in lectures in UQ and in the long term allow other institutions to scalably implement COPUS research tool while meeting data privacy concerns.
